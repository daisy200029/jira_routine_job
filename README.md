JIRA ROUTINE JOB WEBSITE
This will incredibly help QA proccess if they use JIRA to do routine jobs(ex: write test case and open bug)
It can automatically post several bug or multiple test steps to JIRA at one time by using this website.
I also design serveral funtion for my team to auto create tickets which links to developer's ticket, log work , chang ticket status, upload attachment, create test cycles./r/n

Using Below command can see the website.
--python routes.py
